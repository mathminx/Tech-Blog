# Tech-Blog

This CMS-style blog site was created for developers to publish their blog posts from the dashboard and comment on other developersâ€™ posts from the home page. The application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

You mustbe logged in to leave comments.

When you click on the dashboard option in the navigation menu, you are taken to the dashboard, where you will be presented with the titles of all the blog posts you have already created and an option to create a new blog post. When you click on the link to add a new blog post, you are prompted to enter both a title and contents for your blog post. Once you are finished, click on the **Save** button. The title and contents of your post are saved and you are taken back to an updated dashboard that includes your new blog post.

To update the post, make your changes and click the **Update** button to save it. To delete the post, click the **Delete** button. Once the selected blog past has been saved or deleted, you are taken back to the updated dashboard.
